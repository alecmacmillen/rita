This repository contains simple code for creating a word cloud based on the 2,300+ Rita Ora-centric headlines the Daily Mail has released since 2012. 

On the September 17, 2019 episode of minor-celebrity gossip podcast *Who Weekly*, hosts Bobby Finger and Lindsey Weber conducted their regular segment "What's Rita up to?", dedicated to British pop singer/known who Rita Ora. They suggested that a listener of the podcast make a word cloud composed of all the words the Daily Mail, a British tabloid, uses in its famously insane Rita headlines. This project aims to do just that.

The ipython notebook scrapes the Daily Mail's website for headlines marked with the topic "Rita Ora," cleans out HTML characters and stop words, and makes a word cloud of all that remains. Good form, Bella Thorne!
